  <p> I qualified and became a Swiss citizen but couldn’t find a teaching job so began work as an assistant in the Swiss Patent Office in 1901, where I was passed over for promotion because I had not got to grips with “machine technology”.
However, much of my work was linked to the synchronising of time by mechanical and electrical means, which sowed the seeds that would later transform the understanding of the universe.
my first theoretical paper – on the capillary forces of a straw – was published in a respected journal that same year and by 1905 I was awarded my doctorate by the University of Zurich.
The scientist’s work began to pour out of me – by the end of that year, I published no less than four revolutionary papers on matter and energy; the photoelectric effect; Brownian motion; and the idea that perhaps defined him most of all – special relativity.
Despite the acclaim that I began to accrue, I continued working at the patent office until 1909.
Two years later my work on relativity made me world famous when he concluded that the trajectory of light arriving on Earth from a star would be bent by the gravity of the Sun.<br><br> DISCLAIMER------ this description may not be 100% accurate of who I am.</p>
